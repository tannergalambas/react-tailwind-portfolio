## 🧑‍💻 About the Project

This is my personal developer portfolio — a fast, accessible, and fully responsive website built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed on **Vercel**. It showcases my experience, technical skills, and selected front-end projects.

The site is designed to reflect both clean development practices and modern web standards, including performance, SEO, and accessibility.

- **Outcome**: 95+ Lighthouse scores; clear CTAs; simplified contact with Formspree; consistent headings/spacing; analytics for key actions.

### Contact

- Simple, reliable CTAs instead of a fragile client-side form:
  - “Email Me” (mailto), “Copy Email”, and “Resume (PDF)” buttons.
